# Feature Specification: Custom Workout Builder

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-am-building`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Ready for Planning  
**Input**: User description: "I am building a ios app which let's users to create their own workouts. User should be able to create exercises separatly in exercises screen where eich new exercise has title, description, image and youtube url to the exercises, also muscle group selection. Then user can create workouts by selecting from a list of those exercises. When selecting exercise to add to workout user should be able to set number of repetitions and break time (in seconds) between each repetition or if exercises requires to do it not by repetitions count but by time count then user should be able to (maybe move a switch) to add exercises time lenght (in seconds) then adter each added exercises user should see those in a timeline kinda view where he can drag and drop to change order if needed and also should be able to add break between exercises (by adding a break card and setting break time (in seconds))."

## Execution Flow (main)

3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí RESOLVED: All clarifications answered with iOS best practices
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí COMPLETE: Three primary flows identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a fitness enthusiast, I want to create custom workouts from my own exercise library so that I can follow personalized training routines tailored to my goals and preferences. I need to define exercises once with all details (instructions, videos, target muscles), then combine them into different workout sequences with specific repetition counts, durations, and rest periods.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Creating a New Exercise
1. **Given** I am on the exercises screen, **When** I tap "Create New Exercise", **Then** I see a form with fields for title, description, image selection, YouTube URL, and muscle group picker
2. **Given** I have filled all required exercise fields, **When** I save the exercise, **Then** the exercise appears in my exercise library
3. **Given** I have created multiple exercises, **When** I view my exercise library, **Then** I see all exercises displayed with their title and image

#### Scenario 2: Building a Workout
1. **Given** I am on the workout creation screen, **When** I tap "Add Exercise", **Then** I see a list of all my created exercises
2. **Given** I select an exercise to add, **When** I configure it, **Then** I can choose between repetition-based (with rep count and rest between sets) or time-based (with duration in seconds)
3. **Given** I have added multiple exercises, **When** I view the workout timeline, **Then** I see all exercises displayed in order with their configuration
4. **Given** I have exercises in my workout timeline, **When** I long-press and drag an exercise, **Then** I can reorder it to a new position
5. **Given** I am viewing my workout timeline, **When** I tap "Add Break", **Then** I can insert a rest period (in seconds) between exercises

#### Scenario 3: Executing a Workout
1. **Given** I have created a workout, **When** I tap "Start Workout", **Then** I see the workout execution screen with the first exercise displayed prominently with proper background color
2. **Given** I am on the workout execution screen, **When** viewing the current exercise, **Then** I see the exercise image, repetition/time information, a "See Video" button, and a list of upcoming actions below
3. **Given** I am viewing upcoming actions, **When** looking at the list, **Then** I see compact cards showing either exercise names or "Break" labels without full details
4. **Given** I am performing a multi-set exercise, **When** viewing the exercise card, **Then** I see which set I am on (e.g., "Set 1 of 3") and a "Complete Set" button
5. **Given** I complete a set, **When** I tap "Complete Set", **Then** I see a countdown timer for the rest period between sets
6. **Given** I am on a set break, **When** viewing the break screen, **Then** I see a countdown timer showing remaining seconds and indication of which set is coming next
7. **Given** the break timer reaches zero or I skip the break, **When** advancing, **Then** I move to the next set of the same exercise
8. **Given** I reach a regular break between exercises, **When** the break starts, **Then** I see an automatic countdown timer showing remaining seconds with a "Skip Break" button
9. **Given** I am on a regular break, **When** viewing the break screen, **Then** I see the countdown timer in large format counting down to zero
10. **Given** I complete the current exercise or break, **When** I advance, **Then** the next action (exercise or break) becomes the active card

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to create an exercise without filling required fields (title)?
- What happens when a user tries to add an exercise to a workout but has no exercises created yet?
- What happens when a YouTube URL is invalid or the video becomes unavailable?
- How does the system handle images that fail to load or are in unsupported formats?
- What happens when a user tries to start a workout with no exercises added?
- What happens when a user exits the app during workout execution - is progress saved?
- What happens when a break duration is set to 0 seconds?
- Can users delete exercises that are already part of existing workouts?
- What happens when drag-and-drop reordering is performed on a single-item workout?

- **Workout**: Represents a complete training sequence created by the user. Contains a name/title (required) and an ordered collection of workout items (exercises and breaks). Workouts are saved and can be reused multiple times.

- **WorkoutItem**: Represents an instance of an exercise within a specific workout. Contains a reference to the base exercise, configuration type (repetition-based or time-based), and parameters:
  - For repetition-based: number of sets, repetitions per set, rest time between sets (seconds)
  - For time-based: exercise duration (seconds)
  - Position/order within the workout

- **Break**: Represents a rest period between exercises in a workout. Contains duration in seconds and position/order within the workout.
