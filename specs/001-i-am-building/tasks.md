## Task Execution Commands

Each task can be executed using the Task agent. Example commands:

```swift
// T009: Create MuscleGroup enum
"Create Models/MuscleGroup.swift with Swift enum containing 11 muscle group cases (Chest, Back, Shoulders, Biceps, Triceps, Legs, Core, Glutes, Forearms, Calves, Full Body). Conform to String, Codable, CaseIterable, Identifiable protocols. Add sfSymbolName computed property returning appropriate SF Symbol for each case."

// T029: Implement ExerciseService
"Implement Exercises/Services/ExerciseService.swift conforming to ExerciseServiceProtocol. Use SwiftData ModelContext for persistence. Implement all CRUD operations (create, update, delete, fetch). Add validation for title (1-100 chars), YouTube URL (regex pattern), muscle groups (min 1), image size (<2MB). Implement search by title (case-insensitive). Handle all error cases with ExerciseServiceError. Follow async/await patterns."

// T043: Create ExerciseListView
"Create Exercises/Views/ExerciseListView.swift with SwiftUI List showing exercises using @Query. Include search bar, pull-to-refresh, navigation to detail view, '+' button for create, empty state view ('No exercises yet'), swipe-to-delete with confirmation alert.

## Notes

### TDD Enforcement
- **üî¥ Red**: T014-T025 write tests that MUST FAIL
- **üü¢ Green**: T029-T032 implement services to make tests pass
- **üîµ Refactor**: T064 optimize after tests pass

### Commit Strategy
- Commit after each task completion
- Use descriptive messages: `"[T009] Create MuscleGroup enum with 11 cases"`
- Tag after phase completion: `phase-3.4-services-complete`

### Parallel Execution
- Tasks marked [P] can run simultaneously
- Use multiple terminal windows or automation
- Example: Open 5 Chat sessions for T009-T013

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
‚åòU in Xcode

# Run specific test class
# Right-click test class ‚Üí Run

# View code coverage
# Product ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Show Code Coverage
# Target: 70%+ for Services and ViewModels

# Run UI tests on simulator
# Select iPhone 15 Pro simulator ‚Üí ‚åòU
```

### Common Patterns
```swift
// SwiftData @Model
@Model
final class EntityName {
    @Attribute(.unique) var id: UUID
    var property: String
    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade) var related: [RelatedEntity]
}

// @Observable ViewModel
@Observable
final class FeatureViewModel {
    private let service: ServiceProtocol
    var items: [Item] = []
    var isLoading = false
    var errorMessage: String?
    
    func loadItems() async { ... }
}

// SwiftUI View
struct FeatureView: View {
    @Environment(\.modelContext) private var modelContext
    @State private var viewModel: FeatureViewModel
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack { ... }
    }
}
